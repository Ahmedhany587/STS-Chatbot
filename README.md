# Project: AI Conversation and Audio Management Platform

## Overview
This project is a conversational AI platform designed to facilitate engaging and empathetic interactions with users. It integrates text-to-speech (TTS), audio recording and playback, and advanced conversational AI capabilities. The platform is intended to be used in educational settings, specifically at the Monglish International Academy, to assist students in improving their English-speaking skills through interactive conversations.

## Key Features

1. **AI-Powered Conversations:**
   - Uses a custom AI model to generate conversational responses based on context and user input.
   - Maintains conversation history with context analysis to enhance interactions.

2. **Audio Recording and Playback:**
   - Real-time audio recording using `pyaudio` with customizable sample rate and chunk size.
   - Playback functionality with `pygame` for seamless user experience.

3. **Text-to-Speech (TTS):**
   - Utilizes AWS Polly for speech synthesis.
   - Converts AI-generated responses to high-quality audio output.

4. **Session Management:**
   - Tracks and stores conversation history in JSON format for future reference.
   - Organizes sessions by topic and timestamps.

## Project Structure

### Configuration
**File:** `config/settings.py`
- Handles environment variables using `dotenv`.
- Centralizes configuration for AI models, AWS credentials, and audio settings.

### Core Components

1. **Audio Manager**
   **File:** `core/audio_manager.py`
   - `AudioRecorder`: Records audio input from the user.
   - `AudioPlayer`: Plays audio responses generated by the TTS module.

2. **Conversation Manager**
   **File:** `core/conversation_manager.py`
   - Manages conversation flow, including user inputs and AI responses.
   - Saves session history to a structured format for analysis.

3. **Text-to-Speech**
   **File:** `core/text_to_speech.py`
   - Converts AI-generated text to audio using AWS Polly.
   - Includes advanced text cleaning and segmentation for optimal TTS performance.

### AI Model
**File:** `models/ai_model.py`
- Interfaces with Googleâ€™s Gemini generative AI to produce conversational responses.
- Supports context-aware reply generation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- AWS Account with Polly enabled.
- Google API Key for generative AI integration.
- Required libraries (specified in `requirements.txt`).

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following variables:
     ```env
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
     AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
     AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
     ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Start a new conversation:
   - Use the `ConversationManager` to initialize a session and generate AI responses.

2. Record audio:
   - Call the `AudioRecorder.start_recording()` method to start recording user input.
   - Use `AudioRecorder.stop_recording(file_path)` to save the recording.

3. Play audio:
   - Use `AudioPlayer.play_audio(audio_data)` to playback synthesized or recorded audio.

4. Generate speech:
   - Use `TextToSpeech.synthesize(text)` to convert AI responses into speech audio.
