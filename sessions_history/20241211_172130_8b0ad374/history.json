While there isn't a strict classification into distinct types like \"type A\" and \"type B\",  autism is understood to present on a spectrum.  Different people experience it in unique ways, varying in things like communication styles, social interactions, and sensory sensitivities.  It's really about the *range* of autistic experiences.  Are you curious about any specific aspects of that range, or want to know more about the diagnostic process?\n",

Autism is like that rainbow \u2013  lots of different shades and ways of experiencing the world.  Some people might love bright colors and loud sounds, while others might find them overwhelming.  It's all about how each person's brain processes information differently.  Different strengths and challenges can show up in how people communicate, play, and connect with others.  Is there anything specific you'd like to know more about?\n",

Unfortunately, we don't have a complete picture of *exactly* how every autistic brain works.  Scientists are still learning, and research is ongoing.  What we do know is that autistic brains process information differently.  This can lead to different ways of perceiving the world, communicating, and interacting with others.  For example, some autistic people might have heightened sensitivities to sensory input, while others might have a strong focus on specific interests.  Are you curious about any particular aspect of that difference in processing?\n",
